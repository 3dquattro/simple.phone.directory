# simple.phone.directory
## Simple PHP-written phone directory
What is it for? It was written as an addon to helpdesk service.
It is written as fast and as user-friendly as possible. This directory doesn't even has input verification in administrator "panel" if you can call it so, no authorization - just because it was useless for the task.
Fast-written and user-friendly.
